# Careers in Computer Science
Made by Lydia He

## The Basics
### **Job Name:** Data Analyst
<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7567444/pexels-photo-7567444.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

### Description, Typical Duties and Responsibilities
Data Analysts use software to analyze information to make informed decisions. The information is then stored in the databases that Data Analysts test to find the data's reliability. Most Data Analysts work on teams and must be able to communicate effectively with developers, managers, and other workers. When working for a business, they must determine the success of specific initiatives based on past trends. 

### Required Education
To become a Data Analyst, you need the knowledge and skills earned from a University degree, specifically, a bachelor's degree. Data Analysts usually graduated from programs in computer science or mathematics. There is no specific required degree, but technological and statistical knowledge is a must. Computer programming experience is required, but your degree does not have to be directly related as long as you have the necessary skills. 

### Required Technical and Non-Technical Skills
Future Data Analysts should be prepared to demonstrate technical skills like using online tools and programs. Additional non-technical skills include usage of analytical skills, communication skills, being detail-oriented, having logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

## Standard Education
### **Canadian Institution:** UBC
#### **Program:** Data Science

At the University of British Columbia (UBC), Data Science is offered at their Okanagan campus in various ways. It is a 4-year undergraduate program under the Bachelor of Science (BSc). Students can pursue this field by completing a BSc with a Major in Data Science or a BSc Data Science Honours.

#### Entrance Requirements
General admission requirements for all high school students applying to UBC include high school graduation and at least six Grade 12 courses. Entrance requirements when applying to UBCâ€™s BSc at Okanagan are these courses: 

**Grade 12:**
> * ENG4U (English)
> * MHF4U (Advanced Functions) (minimum 67%)
> * and one of the following: SBI4U (Biology), SCH4U (Chemistry), or SPH4U (Physics)

**Grade 11:**
> * SCH3U (Chemistry)

#### First-Year Courses
In your first year, compulsory courses include:

**CHEM 111 - Principles of Chemistry I:**
> Stoichiometry, atomic and molecular structure, chemical periodicity, gases, liquids, solids, and solutions. Not open to students with Chemistry 12.

**COSC 111 - Computer Programming I:**
> Introduction to the design, implementation, and understanding of computer programs. Topics include problem solving, algorithm design, and data and procedural abstraction, with emphasis on the development of working programs. This course should be followed by COSC 121.

**PHYS 111 - Introductory Physics for the Physical Sciences I:**
> Introduction to mechanics primarily for students majoring in the physical sciences (e.g. physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, geology, physical geography) or engineering. Particle kinematics and dynamics, work and energy, momentum, gravitation, rigid body motion, fluid statics and dynamics with applications to the physical sciences. Students with Physics 12 may apply for a tutorial exemption.

**MATH 100 - Differential Calculus with Applications to Physical Sciences and Engineering:**
> Derivatives of elementary functions, limits. Covers applications and modelling: graphing and optimization.

#### A sample of other things necessary to complete the degree or diploma requirements:
To be eligible for graduation with the BSc degree, you must complete at least 48 credits at the 300/400 level, of which at least 30 credits must be completed at UBC. A GPA minimum of 60% is needed. 

In your third and fourth year, there will be an extension of the first year courses, including more math, Statistics, Data, Computer Ethics, Psychometrics, and Advanced Field Ecology. 

#### **Length of Time to Complete the Diploma:** 4 Years
