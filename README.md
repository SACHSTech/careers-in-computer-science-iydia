### Description, Typical Duties and Responsibilities
Data Analysts use software to analyze information to make informed decisions. The information is then stored in the databases that Data Analysts test to find the data's reliability. Most Data Analysts work on teams and must be able to communicate effectively with developers, managers, and other workers. When working for a business, they must determine the success of specific initiatives based on past trends. 

### Required Education
To become a Data Analyst, you need the knowledge and skills earned from a University degree, specifically, a bachelor's degree. Data Analysts usually graduated from programs in computer science or mathematics. There is no specific required degree, but technological and statistical knowledge is a must. Computer programming experience is required, but your degree does not have to be directly related as long as you have the necessary skills. 

### Required Technical and Non-Technical Skills
Future Data Analysts should be prepared to demonstrate technical skills like using online tools and programs. Additional non-technical skills include usage of analytical skills, communication skills, being detail-oriented, having logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
